- ## About Zig
  
  Zig is a modern, general-purpose programming language designed for robustness, optimality, and clarity. It offers fine-grained control over hardware, manual memory management, and a no-hidden-control-flow philosophy, making it ideal for systems programming, embedded development, and high-performance applications. Zig’s built-in package manager, cross-compilation support, and C, C++ interoperability further enhance its appeal as a simple, fast, and safe alternative to C and C ++.

  I'm starting with the basics and will gradually progress to more advanced topics. This index will be updated as I add more notes to the collection.
